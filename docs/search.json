In contrast to traditional gradient descent, which updates the model parameters based on the entire dataset, SGD updates the parameters based on a randomly selected subset of the data, known as a batch. This results in faster training times and makes SGD particularly useful for large datasets.\nFor every step \\(t\\), rather than updating \\(w\\) using the entire dataset, we use a small randomly selected (\\(k\\)) data points to update \\(w\\). Therefore, the new gradient is \\(2(\\tilde{X}\\tilde{X}^Tw^t - \\tilde{X}\\tilde{y})\\) where \\(\\tilde{X}\\) and \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is the small sample randomly selected from the dataset. This is manageable because \\(\\tilde{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}\\) which is considerably smaller than \\(X\\).\nAfter T rounds, we use, \\[\nw ^T _{SGD} = \\frac{1}{T}  \\sum _{i=1} ^T w^i\n\\] This has a certain guarantee to have optimal convergence partly because of the randomness involved in it."

It calculates the probability of a sample belonging to a class by estimating the conditional probability of each feature given the class and then multiplying them together using Bayes’ theorem. Despite its simple assumption, Naive Bayes is known to perform well in various applications, particularly when there are many features but relatively few training examples."

This technique is also known as Laplace smoothing.\nBriefly speaking, Laplace smoothing is a technique used to address the zero-frequency problem in probabilistic models, particularly in text classification. It involves adding a small constant value to the count of each feature and the number of unique classes to avoid zero probability estimates, which can cause problems during model training and prediction. By adding this smoothing term, the model becomes more robust and can handle unseen data more effectively."

The goal of logistic regression is to estimate the probability that the dependent variable is one of the two possible values, given the values of the independent variables.\nIn logistic regression, the dependent variable is modeled as a function of the independent variables using a logistic(sigmoid) function, which produces an S-shaped curve that ranges between 0 and 1. The logistic function transforms the output of a linear combination of the independent variables into a probability estimate, which can then be used to classify new observations.\nLet \\(D=\\{(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n,y_n)\\}\\) be the dataset, where \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) and \\(y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\).\nWe know, \\[\nP(y=1|x) = g(w^Tx_i) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-w^Tx}}\n\\] Using Maximum Likelihood, we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{L}(w;\\text{Data}) &= \\prod _{i=1} ^{n} (g(w^Tx_i))^{y_i}(1- g(w^Tx_i))^{1-y_i} \\\\\n\\log(\\mathcal{L}(w;\\text{Data})) &= \\sum _{i=1} ^{n} y_i\\log(g(w^Tx_i))+(1-y_i)\\log(1- g(w^Tx_i)) \\\\\n&= \\sum _{i=1} ^{n} y_i\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-w^Tx_i}}\\right)+(1-y_i)\\log\\left(\\frac{e^{-w^Tx_i}}{1+e^{-w^Tx_i}}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum _{i=1} ^{n} \\left [ (1-y_i)(-w^Tx_i) - \\log(1+e^{-w^Tx_i}) \\right ]\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, our objective, which is maximizing the log-likelihood function, is given by, \\[\n\\max _{w}\\sum _{i=1} ^{n} \\left [ (1-y_i)(-w^Tx_i) - \\log(1+e^{-w^Tx_i}) \\right ]\n\\] But, there is no closed form solution for this.
