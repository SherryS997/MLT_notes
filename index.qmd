## About the Course
To introduce the main methods and models used in machine learning problems of regression, classification and clustering. To study the properties of these models and methods and learn about their suitability for different problems.

## What you'll learn
* Demonstrating In depth understanding of machine learning algorithms - model, objective or loss function, optimization algorithm and evaluation criteria.
* Tweaking machine learning algorithms based on the outcome of experiments - what steps to take in case of underfitting and overfitting.
* Being able to choose among multiple algorithms for a given task.
* Developing an understanding of unsupervised learning techniques.
